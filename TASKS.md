### TASK-006 and TASK-007 — Transparent transport and Ollama provider

Goal:
Forward OpenAI-compatible requests without dropping unknown fields, and support
model discovery plus non-streaming Chat Completions through Ollama.

Completed:
- added a reusable OpenAI-compatible transport with byte-targeted top-level
  model rewriting, context cancellation, shared HTTP-client reuse, and exact
  preservation of every other request field
- added Ollama model discovery through its OpenAI-compatible model endpoint
- exposed discovered models under provider-qualified public IDs
- added OpenAI-compatible model-list, model-retrieval, and non-streaming Chat
  Completions handlers
- explicitly reject streaming requests until TASK-008
- added transport, provider, and end-to-end handler contract tests
- wired configuration loading, Ollama providers, bearer authentication, health
  checks, and the OpenAI handler into the `gateway serve` executable
- added a process-level test that builds and starts the gateway and requests its
  authenticated model catalog
- ensured graceful shutdown waits for active requests to finish, up to the
  configured 10-second shutdown deadline
- made routing-field extraction case-sensitive so unknown case variants cannot
  override the requested provider or model
- extract routing fields without copying unrelated large request values, return
  413 for bodies over 32 MiB, and distinguish client validation failures from
  upstream failures
- validate configured bearer keys at startup and bound idle HTTP connections
- preserve escaped provider base paths and remove response headers named by
  upstream `Connection` tokens
- preserve escaped trailing base-path slashes, strictly reject trailing commas,
  strip proxy connection headers, validate model catalogs, and bound model
  discovery calls without limiting inference

Decisions:
- gateway client authorization is never forwarded to Ollama
- upstream status, body, and end-to-end response headers are relayed for Chat
  Completions while hop-by-hop headers are removed
- model discovery currently fails the aggregate request when a configured
  provider is unavailable; partial-catalog policy remains future work

### Continuous integration workflow

Added a minimal GitHub Actions workflow for pushes to `main` and pull requests
targeting `main`. CI verifies formatting and module tidiness, runs `go vet`, the
standard and race-enabled test suites, and builds all packages using the Go
version declared in `go.mod`.

---

### Documentation workflow clarification

Clarified that documentation updates are required for durable changes to
architecture, public behavior, configuration, developer workflow, and
significant design decisions. Narrow task-specific test commands no longer need
to be added to `docs/development.md` unless they are reusable development
procedures.

---

### TASK-005 — Provider/model ID parsing

Goal:
Parse public model IDs into validated provider namespaces and upstream model
IDs.

Completed:
- added provider ID validation shared by configuration and model ID parsing
- split public model IDs on the first slash only
- rejected missing separators and empty upstream model IDs
- added tests for simple and OpenRouter-style nested model IDs

Decisions:
- parsing returns no partial provider or model value when validation fails
- upstream model IDs are otherwise preserved verbatim, including nested slashes

---

### TASK-004 — Gateway bearer authentication

Goal:
Protect gateway API handlers with the configured bearer API key.

Completed:
- added the extensible client authenticator and identity contracts
- added static `Authorization: Bearer` authentication for the v1 API key
- compared fixed-size API-key digests in constant time
- added OpenAI-style JSON authentication errors and bearer challenges
- added focused middleware, credential rejection, and identity tests
- made the middleware fail closed for missing authenticators and identities

Decisions:
- all missing, malformed, duplicate, and invalid credentials return the same
  response to avoid exposing authentication details
- store and compare SHA-256 digests so comparisons remain fixed-length even
  when a presented credential has a different length

---

### TASK-003 — Secret references

Goal:
Load secrets referenced by environment variables or files without allowing
secret values in YAML.

Completed:
- added a reusable `SecretRef` with strict exactly-one-source validation
- added environment-variable resolution without altering the stored value
- added file resolution with surrounding whitespace trimming
- added optional server API-key secret configuration for strict YAML loading
- added focused validation, resolution, and configuration decoding tests

Decisions:
- environment values are preserved exactly; only file-backed values are
  whitespace-trimmed as required
- missing environment variables and unreadable files fail resolution without
  exposing secret values in errors

---

### TASK-002 — YAML configuration loader

Goal:
Load and validate the initial gateway configuration.

Completed:
- added strict single-document YAML decoding with unknown-field rejection
- added file-based configuration loading
- validated listener and state settings plus the minimal Ollama provider schema
- validated provider IDs, uniqueness, supported type, and HTTP(S) base URLs
- added focused loader and validation tests

Decisions:
- used `gopkg.in/yaml.v3`, because the Go standard library has no YAML decoder
- intentionally reject configuration for providers and subsystems that are not
  implemented yet

---

### TASK-001 — Bootstrap Go project

Goal:
Create the initial Go project and repository structure.

Requirements:
- Go module
- cmd/gateway/main.go
- internal package directories required for Milestone 1
- docs directory
- project builds
- no unnecessary dependencies

Acceptance:
- `go build ./...` succeeds
- `go test ./...` succeeds

Completed:
- initialized the Go module and gateway command
- added the Milestone 1 package skeleton for API, configuration, providers,
  and upstream transports
- kept the module dependency-free
- documented and verified the repository-wide build and test commands

## TODO

### TASK-008 — SSE streaming relay

Implement low-overhead streaming passthrough and cancellation.
